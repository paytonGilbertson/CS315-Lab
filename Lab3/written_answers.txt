1. No change in display. Translate() only modifies the z-axis by -10 and 
    leaves the other two axes the same. Since the crosshare is at
    (0, 0, 0), the camera must be further in the z-axis for it to be 
    visible.

2. Everything that was on the canvas disapears. The camera is at 
    (0, 0, 0) so it is inside the contents of the canvas making them 
    not within the view of the camera.

4. 
    a. Height of the canvas is cut in half and the 3D drawing is also 
        half of its regular size.

    b. Width is cut in half and the 3D drawing is to wide to fit on 
        the canvas.

10. You would have to counteract the rotation before creating the bookmark array. 
    Rotate mv at the beginning by 90 degrees on the X axis to see top down.
    To leave your x and y axes as is, you would have to rotate by 90 degrees on the X-axis right before creating the bookmark array.
